# Tachyon
Sub-linear Algorithms in C#

## What's sub-linear and why is it cool? 


## Why Tachyon 
There are two types of sublinear algorithms: those which are sublinear in speed and those sublinear in memory. The name stems from the former. When someone says "fast," I don't think of Formula 1 cars but Tachyons. These little particles move faster than the speed of light. In the future they are used for Tachyon detection grids which uncloak Romulan ships ;-) (sorry, it's one of my life's priniciples to have at least one Sci-Fi reference in every technical text and unit test). After having decided that the name is Trekky and therefore cool (do cool kids still use cool? Who knows? Oh and yes, it's also a fault of mine to make use of too many parantheses.), I retrospectively found a reason why it also fits this project. 

Light speed is usually / probably / always (you pick!) the maximum speed of information. The smaller distances infomation must travel through the CPU, the theoretically faster is the data processing. Logic in a CPU is built into curcuits. By building smaller circuits, we decresase the distances travelled by the information and we can increase speed. Unfortunately, this also increase heat which limits minitiuarization. If we could increase the speed of the input over and above light speed, we could increase the speed of the circuit without making it smaller. I fear electricity that travels faster would also generate more heat (probably it does; so I won't think a.k.a. google it because a falty argument is better than renaming the library). So let's just ignore this and think of a tachyon based computer to be much faster than a normal computer on the same minitiatuarization level.

Sub-linear algorithms limit the amount of data travelled through the CPU. That decreases the amount of computation needed which increases the speed over and above the practical limit of the CPU compared to an algorithm that uses the complete data set. Just as (and now comes the beautiful metaphor) tachyons could increase the speed of a CPU at the same miniaturization level, so do linear algorithms. That's (and now comes a lie) why this libary is called Tachyon.
